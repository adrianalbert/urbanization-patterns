# urbanization-patterns

This project develops a "city simulator" based on Generative Adversarial Networks.

We integrate key remote-sensing macro-economic data on cities, available world-wide:
* nightlights from NASA's VIIRS mission
* population density from ORNL's LandScan
* built areas from DLR's Global Urban Footprint project
